Dictionary and Sets

They both use to store the data as a container but they are different from List and Tuples

1. Dictionary (dict)

Purpose: Store data as key–value pairs.

Structure: { key: value, key2: value2, ... }

Order: Maintains insertion order (Python 3.7+).

Mutability: Mutable – you can add, update, or remove items.

Keys: Must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).

Values: Can be any type (mutable or immutable).

Duplicates: Keys must be unique, values can repeat.

Lookup Speed: Very fast for accessing data by key (hash-based lookup).


2. Set (set)

Purpose: Store unique, unordered elements.

Structure: {element1, element2, ...}

Order: Unordered (no fixed position for elements).

Mutability: The set itself is mutable, but elements must be immutable.

Duplicates: Not allowed – adding a duplicate has no effect.

Usage: Great for removing duplicates or checking membership quickly.
